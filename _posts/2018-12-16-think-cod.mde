I welcome you to my Leom's Hub, where we will be discussing on the life and the way of becoming a developer.

I am a Csc Undergraduate, i develop passion in the late 2015. Due to financial instability, i couldn't help
but forsake the passion. Early 2017, i met with different people in the world of tech and this change my life.

I begin to think for a better future in technology, here am I today!!!

What you need to become a developer, includes:
1. Uninterupted power supply
2. A good Laptop with good configuration (depending on your stack)
3. A code editor
4. Internet connection
5. Your passion and love for coding.

Voilla you're up.

Once again, I welcome you here.... Follow up.
